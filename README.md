# unit_test_template

After years of coding, my unittesting settled on this kind of personal 
convetion. I use this to have it accessible, when coding on someones premises. 
It consists of a template for testing functions with side effects and instance
method with side effects, which helps me to avoid most of boilerplate coding 
when unittesting.
